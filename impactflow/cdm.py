        The sensitivity analysis is performed using the Sobol sensitivity analysis method, which
        is suitable for nonlinear, non-monotonic, and high-dimensional model spaces. It provides
        a quantitative measure of how much each input lever contributes to the output variability.

        Parameters:
        - outcome_name (str): The name of the outcome variable for which the sensitivity analysis
                              is to be performed.
        - n_samples (int): The number of samples to generate for the analysis. A higher number of
                           samples will lead to more accurate estimates but increase computation time.

        Returns:
        - S1 (numpy.ndarray): The first-order Sobol sensitivity indices for each lever, indicating
                              the direct contribution of each input to the variance of the output.
        - ST (numpy.ndarray): The total effect sensitivity indices for each lever, capturing both
                              the direct effects and all higher-order interactions involving the input.

        The method defines the problem for SALib, generates parameter values using the Saltelli
        sampling scheme, evaluates the model output for each sample, and then performs the Sobol
        sensitivity analysis on the collected outputs.

        Note:
        - The 'bounds' for each lever are extracted directly from the model elements.
        - The outcome function is assumed to require all lever values as inputs for the evaluation.
        - The Sobol analysis method is used to calculate both first-order and total effect indices,

        """
        Validates the Causal Decision Model to ensure its integrity and readiness for decision analysis.
        This method performs several critical checks:

        1. Checks that there is at least one Lever in the model. Levers are crucial as they represent
           the decision variables that can be manipulated to influence outcomes.

        2. Verifies the existence of at least one Outcome. Outcomes are the variables of interest that
           the decision model aims to influence or optimize, and their presence is essential for the model's purpose.

        3. Ensures all inputs to DecisionTail elements (which represent decision nodes with dependencies)
           come from existing elements within the model. This check prevents references to undefined elements,
           ensuring the model's logical consistency.

        4. Detects cycles within the directed graph that represents the model. Cycles indicate circular dependencies,
           which are not allowed as they can cause infinite loops and disrupt the model's logic.

        5. Checks for unconnected components within the graph. A fully connected model is necessary to ensure
           that changes in levers can influence all outcomes, making the model coherent and integrated.

        6. Verifies that each outcome is reachable from at least one lever, ensuring the model's
           practicality by confirming that levers can indeed influence outcomes.

        7. Confirms that every lever in the model can potentially affect at least one outcome, ensuring all
           elements of the model contribute to its decision-making capabilities.

        If any of these checks fail, a ValueError is raised with a message explaining the specific issue.
